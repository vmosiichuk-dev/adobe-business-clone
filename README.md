## Clone of the Adobe Business home page
Project is aimed at showcasing my skills in reverse engineering, creating & following design patterns and problem solving, by creating a clone of an existing web page. 
To challenge myself, I chose to write styles exclusively with Tailwind CSS to learn this framework in greater detail.
Mobile First Approuch was chosen for this project, since Tailwind CSS media queries are much easier to apply while upscaling from mobile to desktop devices.
